## Integrating Structural Causal Models with SAP Audit Management for Automated Hypothesis Generation

This repository contains the implementation and resources for a novel approach to internal auditing that leverages Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and SAP data integration for automated hypothesis generation and testing.

### Introduction

Traditional audit processes often rely on rule-based systems and manual hypothesis generation, which can be time-consuming and may miss complex relationships in data. This project introduces a paradigm shift in internal auditing by:

1. Automating hypothesis generation using Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
2. Integrating directly with SAP systems for real-time data analysis
3. Providing a framework for continuous, AI-driven audit processes

Our approach allows for:

- **Faster Risk Detection**: Identify potential issues before they become significant problems
- **More Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyze entire datasets instead of samples
- **Causal Inference**: Understand the root causes of audit findings, not just correlations
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Move from periodic to real-time auditing

### Key Features

- SAP data extraction and preprocessing pipeline
- SCM implementation for causal discovery in audit data
- Automated hypothesis generation and prioritization
- Statistical testing framework for hypothesis validation
- Integration with SAP Audit Management for workflow automation

### Getting Started

To use this framework, you'll need:

- Python 3.8+
- SAP HANA database access
- Relevant SAP modules (FI, CO, MM, etc.)

Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SCM-SAP-Audit-Hypothesis-Automation.git
cd SCM-SAP-Audit-Hypothesis-Automation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Configure SAP connection in `config/sap_config.yaml`
2. Run data extraction: `python scripts/extract_sap_data.py`
3. Generate hypotheses: `python scripts/generate_hypotheses.py`
4. View results in `output/audit_report.pdf`
